# 1. Make a blog

You can do it here on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on Wordpress, for free. 

The microblogging platform [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/); for $5/month ($10 if you want to podcast & get other features) is a great short-form compliment to your long-form blog. You can own your turf & help cultivate the open web.

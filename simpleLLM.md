# Train and deploy a simple LLM, then test it to find its weaknesses

## Learning Path

This learning path is from [Sebastian Raschka](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastianraschka_a-suggestion-for-an-effective-11-step-llm-activity-7195778889384693762-2TB_). I've been working through his book [*Building a Large Language Model (from Scratch)*](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch). It's excellent, but perhaps quite advanced if you're new to these ideas. When he refers to chapters, he's talking about the chapters in this book.

A suggestion for an effective 11-step LLM summer study plan:

1. Read* Chapters 1 and 2 on implementing the data loading pipeline (https://lnkd.in/gfruEiwm & https://lnkd.in/gyDm4h3y).
2. Watch Karpathy's video on training a BPE tokenizer from scratch (https://lnkd.in/gZEsdpYc).
3. Read Chapters 3 and 4 on implementing the model architecture.
4. Watch Karpathy's video on pretraining the LLM.
5. Read Chapter 5 on pretraining the LLM and then loading pretrained weights.
6. Read Appendix E on adding additional bells and whistles to the training loop.
7. Read Chapters 6 and 7 on finetuning the LLM.
8. Read Appendix E on parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA.
9. Check out Karpathy's repo on coding the LLM in C code (https://lnkd.in/gHpt5uh9).
10. Check out LitGPT to see how multi-GPU training is implemented and how different LLM architectures compare (https://lnkd.in/gzYc69c7).
11. Build something cool and share it with the world.

(*"Read" = read, run the code, and attempt the exercises 😊)

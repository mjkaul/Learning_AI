# Learning_AI

Here's a blog that documents what I'm learning about knowledge graphs &amp; LLMs. 

I have specific interests & objectives re: AI.

I've been very skeptical of many of the claims being made about the nature of AI tools and their relationship to human consciousness (&amp; I often write about these topics on my LinkedIn page)—but that doesn't mean that many of these AI tools aren't amazing & exciting. 

Working in the healthcare industry, though, standard LLMs simply aren't going to cut it from a quality perspective. When it comes to generative AI in heatlhcare, an AI tool's output needs to be both verifiable (meaning it meets your requirements, including requirements for truthfulness and reliability) and validatable (meaning it meets your user's needs). 

Hence my interest in the combination of LLMs and knowledge graphs, or what Microsoft and others are calling "GraphRAG." 

I'm not a great coder; mostly just a technical writer starting from more or less nothing beyond some beginner-level Python & JS. I'll share my code snippets here from the various mostly Python-based AI/ML projects I'm working on—but be warned, things are gonna get messy. I do try to annotate my code carefully to make sure I know what's happening where. 

I'll also create a general glossary for all the terms I'm learning, and different collections of posts for the different books and projects I work through. 

I'd be very happy to hear your thoughts about what I'm up to, as well as your corrections & suggestions. Thanks in advance!

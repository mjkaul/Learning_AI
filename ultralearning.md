# Scott Young, *Ultralearning*

My notes on Scott Young's book *Ultralearning*, which is a great place to start if you're interested in actually learning, not just pursuing a topic you're curious about. Indeed, the book will help you learn dramatically more, in a dramatically shorter period of time, than you would even if you enrolled in a full-time undergraduate program in the subject. My main takeaway from the book is that we're capable of a lot more than we typically expect of ourselves.

The 9 Principles:

1. Metalearning: first draw a map
2. Focus: sharpen your knife
3. Directness: go straight ahead
4. Drill: attack your weakest point
5. Retrieval: test to learn
6. Feedback: don’t dodge the punches
7. Retention: don’t fill a leaky bucket
8. Intuition: dig deep before building up
9. Experimentation: explore outside your comfort zone

# 1. Metalearning: first draw a map

Before starting on any ultralearning project, answer these 3 questions: Why? What? How?

## Why?

- Intrinsic vs instrumental
- Expert interview - does this learning plan line up with your understanding of the field? how did you get there?

## What? 

- Concepts - what needs to be understood?
- Facts - what needs to be memorized?
- Procedures - what needs to be practiced?

- Draw your map - what’s going to require the most work? What will the greatest challenges be and how can you overcome them?

## How?

- Benchmarking - find the common ways it’s done. E.g. find courses, programs, curricula, syllabi for a program in the subject.
- The emphasize/exclude method - find the areas of study most relevant to your goals. Focus on those things; deemphasize others until later.

## The 10% rule

> A good rule of thumb is that you should invest approximately 10% of your total expected learning time into research prior to starting.

## Long-Term Prospects

The most valuable aspect of metalearning for one project is that you can apply what you’ve learned about metalearning to your next project, to keep stacking ultralearning projects throughout your life.

> The best research, resources, and strategies are useless unless you follow up with concentrated efforts to learn.

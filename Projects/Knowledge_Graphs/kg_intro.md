# Build a Knowledge Graph

## Learning Path

There are not a ton of good resources out there on why knowledge graphs are so useful for AI.

But everything I can find I'm collecting here.

A note on terminology: several different terms are used to describe different, sometimes overlapping, areas within this field. "Taxonomy," "ontology," and "knowledge graph" are the three terms that are most usefulâ€”and unfortunately these three terms are often defined interchangeably or ambiguously.

## Objectives

1. Build an ontology / knowledge graph manually.
2. Build an ontology / knowledge graph using data you've imported from elsewhere (e.g. DBpedia).
3. Learn how to map not just data but *processes* into your knowledge graph.
4. Train your LLM on your knowledge graph.

## Concepts

- **Knowledge Graph** - An ontology with instances. So, if you create a taxonomy, add relationships to get an ontology, then add particular instances of the classes and relationships within your ontology, you've got a knowledge graph.
- **Ontology** - A taxonomy, plus mapped sets of relationships between the different class/terms that map your domain. Basically, a taxonomy plus *relationships*.
	- Barry Smith, "Ontology is a representation of the types of entities within a given domain and of the relations between them."
- **Taxonomy** - Hierarchical or structured set of terms used within a domain.

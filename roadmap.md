# Roadmap (subject to perennial revision)

Do the first three steps on your own. Once you've done them, come back here for the rest of it:

0. [Create your Github account.](https://github.com/)
1. [Make a blog.](/makeablog.md)
2. Learn [how to use github](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/guide-to-git-github-for-beginners-and-experienced-devs/) & the pull/commit/branch model.
3. Train your first simple llm & deploy it, then test it & find its weaknesses.
4. *[in progress]* train a more advanced llm & deploy it (use Raschka, *Building a Large Language Model (from Scratch)*), then test & find its weaknesses.
5. Train your first RAG-based LLM & deploy it; then find its weaknesses.
6. Build a knowledge graph w/Neo4j or Protege.
7. Train your graphrag llm & deploy it, then find its weaknesses.
8. Learn about AI Ops: testing, maintaining, & updating the tools you've built.

## Someday/maybe ##

I'll work through the following if/when I get the chance, or as they intersect with some of the projects above:

- Howard & Gugger, *Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch*
- Yuan & Yuan, *Open Source LLMs (Manning 3 Projects)*
- Stephens, *AI Algorithms (Manning 4 Projects)*
- Maiden, *Neo4j (Manning 3 Projects)*
- Elgueta, *LangChain (Manning 3 Projects)*

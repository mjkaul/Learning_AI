# Roadmap (subject to perennial revision)

*Current planned major revision: rebuild this roadmap based on the [Dreyfus model of learning & mastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition).*

Do these steps on your own. Once you've done them, come back here for the rest of it:

## Learning AI 101: The Basics

0. [Create your Github account.](https://github.com/)
1. [Make a blog.](/makeablog.md)
2. Learn [how to use github](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/guide-to-git-github-for-beginners-and-experienced-devs/) & the pull/commit/branch model.
3. Learn the [basic concepts.](/basiconcepts.md)

## Learning AI 201: Building reliable, verifiable AI chatbots

1. Understand and define basic AI terms and concepts.
2. Deploy a standard open-source LLM as-is, with no special training.
3. *[in progress]* [Train & deploy an LLM.](/simpleLLM.md) Then test it and find its weaknesses. This section is long and should be subdivided.
4. Train your first RAG-based LLM & deploy it; then find its weaknesses.

## Learning AI 301: GraphRAG Mastery

5. Build a [knowledge graph](/Projects/Knowledge_Graphs/kg_intro.md) w/Neo4j or Protege.
6. Train your first KG+RAG LLM & deploy it, then find its weaknesses.
7. Learn about AI ops: testing, maintaining, & updating the tools you've built.

## Someday/maybe ##

I'll work through the following if/when I get the chance, or as they intersect with some of the projects above:

- Howard & Gugger, *Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch*
- Yuan & Yuan, *Open Source LLMs (Manning 3 Projects)*
- Stephens, *AI Algorithms (Manning 4 Projects)*
- Maiden, *Neo4j (Manning 3 Projects)*
- Elgueta, *LangChain (Manning 3 Projects)*

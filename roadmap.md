# Roadmap (subject to perennial revision)

Do these steps on your own. Once you've done them, come back here for the rest of it:

0. [Create your Github account.](https://github.com/)
1. [Make a blog.](/makeablog.md)
2. Learn [how to use github](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/guide-to-git-github-for-beginners-and-experienced-devs/) & the pull/commit/branch model.
3. Learn the [basic concepts.](/basiconcepts.md)

## Building reliable, verifiable AI chatbots

1. *[in progress]* [Train & deploy an LLM.](/simpleLLM.md) Then test it and find its weaknesses.
2. Train your first RAG-based LLM & deploy it; then find its weaknesses.
3. Build a [knowledge graph](/Projects/Knowledge_Graphs) w/Neo4j or Protege.
4. Train your first KG+RAG LLM & deploy it, then find its weaknesses.
5. Learn about AI ops: testing, maintaining, & updating the tools you've built.

## Someday/maybe ##

- Howard & Gugger, *Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch*
- Yuan & Yuan, *Open Source LLMs (Manning 3 Projects)*
- Stephens, *AI Algorithms (Manning 4 Projects)*
- Maiden, *Neo4j (Manning 3 Projects)*
- Elgueta, *LangChain (Manning 3 Projects)*

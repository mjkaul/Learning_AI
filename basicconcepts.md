# Basic Concepts #

Work through all the *beginner-level resources* from the [bibliography](/bibliography.md)

Your goal (& mine!) should be to be able to explain each of these concepts clearly and precisely, focusing on the different ways each term can be used and on the distinctions between the terms.

Can you do it? Be honest with yourself. If not, keep working till you can. The only test will be whether or not you can define & make the right distinctions when it counts.

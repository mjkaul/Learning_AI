# Bibliography - books, essays, sites, & learning resources

Probably around half of these are free. But if you're serious about learning, be serious about investing something in your learning. If you're like me, it will help you take your learning project more seriously.

Reach out if you have ideas for things to add.

### Meta ###

These resources relate to how I've structured the project itself—e.g. what assumptions I'm making about how to learn.

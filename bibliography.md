# Bibliography - books, essays, sites, & learning resources

Probably around half of these are free. But if you're serious about learning, be serious about investing something in your learning. If you're like me, it will help you take your learning project more seriously.

Reach out if you have ideas for things to add.

### TBD

### Using AI for Ontologies & KGs ###

A subfield of the KG-->AI field is using AI to help you create, manage, and query KGs.

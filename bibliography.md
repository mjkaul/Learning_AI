# Bibliography - books, essays, sites, & learning resources

All free, mostly free, or at least partly free. Reach out if you have ideas for things to add.

Obviously don't feel compelled to buy the books or pay for courses. Find free alternatives elsewhere; just make sure you cover the same concepts and get somewhere close to the same results in the end. 

### Beginner - start here ### 

- [Andrej Karpathy's vide "Intro to Large Language Models"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuW9U8-vZ_s_cjKPT_FqRStI&index=1)
- [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) - a range of courses from beginner through advanced. 
- Wooldridge, [*A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53359507-a-brief-history-of-artificial-intelligence) - great intro to the history and the basic concepts. Well written & readable. Worthwhile even if you aren't going to do the coding.

### Intermediate ###

- 3blue1brown [video course on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) - long explainer videos.
- [Andrej Karpathy's Github repos](https://github.com/karpathy) - he's doing tons of projects that you can follow along with, particularly [Eureka Labs](https://eurekalabs.ai/), which is going to be some sort of course about AI "taught" with the assistance of AI tutors.
- Raschka, [*Building a Large Language Model (from Scratch)*](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) - I'm working through this one already; it's great so far.
- [Stephen Wolfram's essay on how LLMs work](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) - dense but incredibly thorough.

### Advanced ###

- Howard & Gugger, [*Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/)
- [Andrej Karpathy's vide series "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&si=9DqrnYQ1VXDjLWgo)
- [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)
- [GPT learning hub](https://www.gptlearninghub.ai/codingproblems)
